# MatlabProject
Recieved 100% for my Matlab Project in 2018 for optimising my code from 4 minutes to 2 seconds

# Project Specification
This project requires you to write code that will allow you to 
create k-colour images (where k is a 
specified small number such as 4) from an image containing many hundreds (or even thousands) of 
colours.  The idea is to use the k-means clustering algorithm to group the pixel colours used in the image into clusters.  We can then determine the appropriate colours to use by taking the mean RGB values of each cluster, so that the reduced colour image is as accurate a representation of the original colour image as possible.  On completion of the project you will have written code that can take any arbitrary image and produce a k-colour image where k is a value specified by the user.
